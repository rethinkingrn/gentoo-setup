# gentoo-setup
setup of my gentoo machine \
I don't really know what im going to do with this 

> once i figure out things, this should have my dotfiles, my gentoo configs (kernel and make.conf) 
### INFO
I use git-sources as my kernel not gentoo-sources
> idk why i even use this lmao
### Plans:
- [ ] Import all my configs (like kernel config, make.conf, dotfiles
- [ ] Dont leak any private info
- [ ] Organize the files
